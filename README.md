# Project Name
> This Jupyter Notebook provides an implementation of a linear regression model using Python and scikit-learn library. The notebook demonstrates how to train and evaluate a linear regression model on a given dataset.

## General Information
The project aims to solve a regression problem by predicting the demand for Boom Bikes based on a set of input features. The background of the project involves understanding the relationship between the input features and the demand for bikes, and using this understanding to make accurate predictions.

The business problem that the project addresses is to predict the demand for Boom Bikes based on various features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc. This can be useful for bike rental companies to optimize their inventory and meet customer demand.

The dataset used in this project consists of historical data on bike rentals, including features like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and the number of bikes rented. The dataset is preprocessed and split into training and testing sets to train and evaluate the linear regression model.

## Conclusions
Based on the analysis, the following conclusions can be drawn:
1. The temperature has a positive impact on the demand for bikes, indicating that more bikes are rented on warmer days.
2. The humidity and wind speed have a negative impact on the demand for bikes, suggesting that people are less likely to rent bikes in humid or windy conditions.
3. Other features such as the day of the week, time of day, and holidays may also influence the demand for bikes.

## Technologies Used
The following libraries were used in this project:
- scikit-learn - version 0.24.2
- pandas - version 1.2.4
- numpy - version 1.20.3
- matplotlib - version 3.4.2
